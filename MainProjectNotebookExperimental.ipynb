    "Let's try this method in a different gym environment. The acrobot system includes two joints and two links, where the joint between the two links is actuated. Initially, the links are hanging downwards, and the goal is to swing the end of the lower link up to a given height. The action is either applying +1, 0 or -1 torque on the joint between the two pendulum links. The Observation space or state consists of the sin() and cos() of the two rotational joint angles and the joint angular velocities."

    "One of the reasons the MountainCar-v0 env is harder than the CartPole env is that the goal state is not easily reached randomly, as the car motor does not have enough power by itself to get to the goal, whereas with the CartPole the goal state is the initial state. Due to the nature of the reward in this env, this means the HillClimbing agent rarely if ever reaches a better reward, as it is exploring actions randomly and there is no incremental reward. Over time the increasing variance of the added noise may lead to to improved rewards but it can take a long time."

    "Now let's introduce Q-Learning; it is a reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to find the best action to take given a current state to maximize reward. This algorithm is considered off-policy due to the fact the Q-learning function learns from actions outside the current policy, like taking random actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create a Q-table (or matrix) that follows the shape of [state, action] and we initialize each value in the matrix to zero. We update and store our Q-values in this matrix after each episode. This then becomes a reference table for our agent to select the best action based on the highest Q-value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is to interact with the environment, and update the state-action pairs in our Q-table. This is done in one of two ways: exploiting, or exploring. When exploiting, the Q-table is used as reference to view all possible actions for a given state, and the agent selects the action based on the max value of said action. When exploring, the action is taken randomly. This is important as it allows the agent to explore and discover new states that may not be selected during exploitation. These two modes of interaction with the environment are balanced using a variable usually named epsilon, which determines the probability of exploring versus exploiting. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've mentioned epsilon (exploration probability), one of the hyperparameters, there are others that are useful. The learning rate, sometimes denoted alpha, is how much an updated value is \"accepted\" vs the old one. The difference between the new and old value is multiplied by this learning rate and added to the previous q-value. A discount factor, usually denoted gamma, can be used to balance immediate and future reward."
